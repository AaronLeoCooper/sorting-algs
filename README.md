# Sorting Algorithms with JS

I haven't had a chance in the last few years to exercise my sorting algorithms, so
I feel it's about time I fixed that. This repo showcases algorithms I've been interested
in playing with. Nothing spectacular here, just a bit of self-learning!

After installing it with `yarn install`, run it with: `yarn start`.

NPM should also work too (`npm install`).
